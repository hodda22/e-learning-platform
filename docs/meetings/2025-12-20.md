# Scrum Meeting — 2025-12-20

## Attendees
- Hodda Emad
- Eman Mohammed
- Ryad Elshemy

## Sprint Goal
Deliver the core LearnFlow MVP: main pages UI + authentication modals + course browsing, and agree on Phase 2 deliverables (docs + diagrams + tests + CI/CD + deployment).

## What we did since last meeting
- Created initial project structure (frontend/backend folders) and agreed on file naming and layout.
- Implemented base UI layout (navbar + Home page sections).
- Added basic styling foundation (CSS variables, global styles).
- Drafted initial plan for Login/Signup flow and role selection (Student/Instructor).

## What we will do next
- Finish Login and Signup pages/modals and connect them to client-side storage.
- Implement Courses list UI + Course details view.
- Start backend API skeleton for courses listing (if kept) OR confirm client-side storage approach for Phase 2.
- Create GitHub Issues backlog + Scrum board columns and start tracking tasks there.

## Blockers / Risks
- Unclear final architecture: whether backend API will be required or UI-only is enough for Phase 2 grading.
- Risk of mismatch between documentation/diagrams and actual implementation if architecture changes late.
- Limited time to add CI/CD + deployment if postponed.

## Decisions
- Use simple roles: Student and Instructor (no Admin for now).
- Prioritize working demo features first, then documentation + UML diagrams.
- Track work using GitHub Issues + Projects board (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done).

## Action items
- [ ] Hodda: Complete Navbar/Home UI and integrate navigation to sections — due 2025-12-22
- [ ] Eman: Start backend API skeleton for `/api/courses` (or document fallback if UI-only) — due 2025-12-22
- [ ] Ryad: Prepare initial course dataset structure + tasks list for frontend rendering — due 2025-12-22
- [ ] All: Create GitHub issues for each feature + assign owners — due 2025-12-21
