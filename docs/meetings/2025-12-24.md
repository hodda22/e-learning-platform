# Scrum Meeting — 2025-12-24

## Attendees
- Hodda Emad
- Eman Mohammed
- Ryad Elshemy

## Sprint Goal
Finalize core LearnFlow flows: authentication, course browsing/details, enrollment, and task/progress tracking. Prepare Phase 2 documentation plan (SRS + UML + test cases).

## What we did since last meeting
- Completed Login/Signup UI and validated required fields.
- Implemented Courses page grid and Course Details view.
- Added Enrollment flow and started showing enrolled courses in the Dashboard.
- Implemented Tasks modal with checkbox completion and progress update behavior.
- Agreed on persistence approach (client-side state saved to localStorage) to keep the demo stable.

## What we will do next
- Finish Files/Notes feature (create/edit/save/delete) and ensure it persists in localStorage.
- Add Instructor functionality (create/edit/delete courses) and ensure students cannot enroll as instructors.
- Create UML diagrams (Use-case, 3 sequence diagrams, class diagram; optional component diagram).
- Write the manual test cases document (target 30+ cases) and add a traceability matrix (FR → TC).
- Start GitHub Actions: CI (smoke test) + Deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Blockers / Risks
- Risk that CI/deployment is delayed and becomes a last-minute problem.
- Risk of incomplete GitHub evidence (issues/PRs/meeting notes) if not updated daily.
- LocalStorage persistence can look inconsistent if keys/data formats change during refactoring.

## Decisions
- Confirmed architecture for Phase 2 submission: client-side SPA + localStorage persistence (no external DB required for demo).
- Diagrams must match the real architecture (no fake backend/database sequence flows).
- Use PR-based workflow (feature branches → PR → merge) for all remaining changes.

## Action items
- [ ] Hodda: Export UML diagrams as PNG/SVG and place in `docs/diagrams/` — due 2025-12-26
- [ ] Eman: Set
