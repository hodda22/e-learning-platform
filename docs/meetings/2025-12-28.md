# Scrum Meeting — 2025-12-28

## Attendees
- Hodda Emad
- Eman Mohammed
- Ryad Elshemy

## Sprint Goal
Finalize Phase 2 submission: complete documentation (SRS + UML + test cases), ensure GitHub repo evidence (issues/board/PRs/meeting notes), and deploy the project with CI/CD.

## What we did since last meeting
- Completed Files/Notes feature (create/edit/save/delete) and verified persistence in localStorage.
- Verified task completion toggles update progress correctly and persists after refresh.
- Reviewed all features against the SRS requirements and corrected mismatches in documentation wording.
- Created/updated the Scrum board and added a Future Work backlog item to keep the board realistic.
- Prepared Mermaid UML diagram code for use-case, sequence, class, and component diagrams for export.

## What we will do next
- Export all UML diagrams to PNG/SVG and commit them under `docs/diagrams/`.
- Finish and commit the final SRS document and manual test cases document.
- Convert Project draft cards into real GitHub Issues (so repo shows real issue history).
- Create PRs for docs/diagrams + workflows and merge them into main.
- Enable GitHub Actions workflows (CI + GitHub Pages deploy) and confirm the deployed URL works.

## Blockers / Risks
- GitHub evidence risk: if Issues/PRs are not visible in the repo, the board alone may be considered insufficient.
- Deployment risk: wrong Pages artifact path (frontend vs phase2 folder) could break the live site.
- Time risk: leaving CI/CD setup to the end could cause unexpected workflow errors.

## Decisions
- Final submission architecture confirmed: client-side SPA + localStorage persistence.
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions.
- Keep only P2 “Future Work” items in Backlog; all P0/P1 must be Done before submission.
- Use PR workflow for remaining commits and link PRs to issues using `Closes #<issue>`.
